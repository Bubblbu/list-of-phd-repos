# Awesome list of PhD repos

This is an awesome list of PhD projects that live on GitHub.

## The list

This is not the finalised format of this list. Just adding a few example PhD repos to keep track of suggestions, and have some data to discuss the open questions (see this [issue](https://github.com/Bubblbu/list-of-phd-repos-on-github/issues/1)).

**Finished PhD projects/theses**
- [The Presentation of Self on a Decentralised Web](https://github.com/rhiaro/thesis) by [@Rhiaro](https://twitter.com/rhiaro) - Full thesis available to read on gh-pages

- [ ] Add CSV with initial dataset
- [ ] Write script to render the markdown file
- [ ] *(optional)* Interactive table view to explore dataset on gh-pages
